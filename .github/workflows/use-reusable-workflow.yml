        if : failure() && steps.run-test.outcome == 'failure'
#  if : failure() && steps.run-test.outcome == 'failure' here failure() returns true when previous step or job failed and steps.run-test.outcome
# this condition makes sure that the test job even if it is failing but the test reports will still get uploaded for the previous step.
# So by using if condiiton here we can make a job run even if the previous step is failing.
# In GitHub Actions, failure() is a built-in function that returns true if any previous step in the job has failed.
#It's often used to trigger specific steps like sending alerts or doing cleanup after a failure.
# Meanwhile, steps.run-test.outcome == 'failure' is a condition that checks whether the outcome of the step w ith ID run-test specifically ended in failure.
# So, when you combine them like this: if: failure() && steps.run-test.outcome == 'failure', it means 
#"Run this step only if something in the job has already failed and specifically the step named run-test has failed." This gives you fine-grained control to respond to specific step failures within a job.
